## The Fragmented Picture of Antimicrobial Resistance in Kenya: A Situational Analysis of Antimicrobial Consumption and the Imperative for Antimicrobial Stewardship

## Introduction

The paper presents a situational analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Kenya, examining the drivers of resistance, patterns of antimicrobial consumption, and the status of policy implementation. It highlights how misuse of antibiotics in human health, animal health, and agricultural production, together with weak diagnostics and surveillance gaps, have contributed to a fragmented AMR landscape in Kenya. Despite strong policy frameworks such as the National Action Plan (NAP) on AMR using a One Health approach, implementation challenges persist.

### Methodology

The study employed a two-fold approach:

1. Systematic Scoping Review;

- Searched multiple databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar) for publications on AMR in Kenya.
- Applied PRISMA-ScR guidelines for study screening and selection.
- Included 19 eligible studies that reported on key AMR indicators such as surveillance, stewardship, diagnostics, awareness, and consumption patterns.
- Extracted and charted data based on study settings, variables studied, and key outcomes.
- Included government and policy reports to compensate for research gaps typical in LMICs.

2. Expert Validation

- Conducted an interview with an AMR expert in the Kenyan healthcare
system.
- Validated findings from the scoping review and provided on-the-ground insight into county-level implementation, stewardship barriers, and contextual policy failures.

### Key findings

1. **Drivers of AMR**

- Extensive irrational use of antibiotics in human health.
- Counterfeit and substandard drugs, especially in informal pharmacies.
- Overuse in livestock and agriculture (prophylactic + growth promotion).
- Poor infection prevention, inadequate sanitation (WASH).

2. **Surveillance and Diagnostics**

- Kenya reports to GLASS, but has few sentinel sites and limited county-level coverage.
- Many laboratories lack capacity for bacterial culture or AST, especially in rural settings.
- Diagnostic delays lead to empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

3. **Policy Framework**

- A strong NAP using a One Health model, but decentralized implementation is weak.
Only 8 counties have active stewardship committees.

4. **Health System Challenges**

- Urban–rural inequity, understaffing, inadequate training.
- Heavy reliance on donor funding for AMR programs.
- Limited public awareness and poor community health literacy.

### Implications

- Kenya risks losing first-line antibiotics, leading to extended hospital stays, higher costs, and preventable deaths.
- The One Health approach is promising but only effective with stronger enforcement, funding, and capacity building.
- Without strengthened diagnostics, stewardship remains reactive rather than preventive.
- Failure to regulate informal drug markets enables resistance to spread silently.

### Call to action

- Invest in laboratory systems and point-of-care diagnostics.
- Enforce prescription-only antibiotic laws and regulate informal pharmacies.
- Speed up county-level NAP roll-out through CASIC structures.
- Strengthen AMR awareness campaigns targeting both clinicians and the public.
- Build domestic funding capacity rather than relying on external donors.

### Future research gap

- Lack of real-time AMR data from community and primary care settings.
- Limited evidence from the animal and environmental sectors of One Health.
- Few studies evaluating implementation success of stewardship programs.
- Need for cost-effectiveness analyses of AMR interventions in Kenya.
