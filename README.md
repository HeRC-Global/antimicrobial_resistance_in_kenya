This research paper provides a comprehensive situational analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Kenya, focusing on the drivers of resistance, patterns of antimicrobial consumption, and the status of policy implementation. The study highlights the challenges posed by the misuse of antibiotics across human health, animal health, and agricultural production sectors, alongside weak diagnostics and surveillance systems that contribute to a fragmented AMR landscape in the country. Despite the existence of robust policy frameworks such as the National Action Plan (NAP) on AMR, which adopts a One Health approach, significant implementation challenges remain.
